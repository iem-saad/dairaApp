A semester project, Android application for famous event Daira of FAST-CFD campus.
I am a student of FAST NUCES and I was assigned a semester project in which we have to build an android application using Java. I have properly binded whole application.
There were four types of users of this application which are as following:
- Admin
- Mentors
- Organizing Committee
- Participants

I have divided the activities in four packages each for each type of user and one extra common package or onboarding and login/signup.
Moreover, it was required to use singleton pattern in our app. So, I used it to fetch current signed in user. For login and signup of users I have used firebase authentication for participants and for remaining users firebase Realtime database is used.

For Animations **Lottie by Airbnb** is used.
For Database **Firebase** is used.

## Each User and its responsibilities are given below:


### Admin and their role:

1. Admins areÂ pre-definedÂ persons (already in database) who can log in to the admins
portal.
